#**The Psychic Game**

This is my first attempt at making a little game. 

The objective is to guess the number the computer has picked. You have 10 guesses to pick the right letter and you can even ask for up to two hints if you're really having trouble.  The player wins if they guess the letter correctly 10 times before they are wrong 10 times.


This was a simple but effective exercise to familiarize myself with some basic workings of JavaScript and especially working with arrays.

I plan to return to this game and improve the UX/UI design.
